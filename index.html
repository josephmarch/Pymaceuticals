  <h1>Pymaceuticals</h1>
  <p>Pymaceuticals was an activity that uses fictional pharmaceutical data to test skills related to analyzing data. It supposed you had joined Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego. Pymaceuticals specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In its most recent efforts, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.</p>
  <p>The assignment was to analyze data that had been pulled over a 45 day period relating to tumor development observations and measurements and the performance of Pymaceuticals drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatments.</p>
  <p>The work was done using Python via Jupyter Notebook along with matplotlib.</p>
  <p>Findings at the conclusion of the assignment were that, with the exception of one outlier from the Infubinol trials, the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin had consistent results. There was a strong corrilation between the average tumor volume compared to overall mouse weight and the distribution of female to male mice were nearly equal.</p>
  <p>What follows are some examples of the plotted graphs and their meanings...</p>

  <figcaption>This pie graph shows the distribution of mice was nearly even between female and male for the overall study.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>This scatter plot was used to find our correlation coefficient of 0.84 relating to mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.</figcaption>
