# Pymaceuticals
Work to generate all of the tables and figures for Pymaceuticals' technical report using Python Matplotlib. Pymaceuticals is a mock-up of a pharmaceuticals company which specializes in anti-cancer research. The data of Pymaceuticals is meant to represent research screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. The task is to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study.

## Graphs:
This bar graph displays the total number of timepoints for each drug regimen, which relates to how many mice were involved in the study of each.

This pie graph shows the distribution of mice was nearly even between female and male for the overall study.

This box plot shows the final tumor volume of each mouse across four regimens of interest, showing our outlier.

This scatter plot was used to find our correlation coefficient of 0.84 relating to mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin regimen.

## Findings
With the exception of one outlier from the Infubinol trials, the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin had consistent results. There was a strong corrilation between the average tumor volume compared to overall mouse weight and the distribution of female to male mice were nearly equal.
